# Text-Based RPG Game Demo

++ text-based RPG** built in Visual Studio.  
It demonstrates a clean, state-driven architecture for handling player stats, databases, combat, exploration, and game flow.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Hand-crafted Dungeon**: A carefully designed dungeon layout with unique rooms, puzzles, and encounters. Unlike the overworld, this area is static and intentionally built to deliver a specific challenge and atmosphere. Includes an NPC and obtainable loot.
- **Stat-based Progression System**: This game follows a use‑based progression model. Each stat (such as Strength, Agility, or Magic) improves naturally the more you rely on it.
- **CombatSystem**: A turn‑based battle engine where the player chooses actions (attack, defend, cast spells, use items, attempt escape). The system handles damage calculation, enemy AI, and win/lose conditions.
- **Items**: Collectible consumables such as potions or key items.
- **Equipment**: Weapons, armor, and accessories that can be equipped to improve player stats. Equipment adds progression and customization to your character build.
- **Spells**: A magic system that lets players cast offensive, defensive, or utility spells. Spells consume resources (like mana) and add strategic depth to combat.
- **Discoveries**: Secrets, or special events uncovered through interactions or while exploring. An unintrusive quest system.
- **Procedurally Generated Overworld**: A dynamic overworld map that is generated differently each playthrough. This ensures replayability, with new terrain, encounters, and exploration opportunities every time.
